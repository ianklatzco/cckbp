" for me this means: if using programmer's dvorak, then consider mapping the numbers on command mode to just be the numbers as opposed to the symbols which is default for insert/general kb usage.

" use programmer dvorak because why not. map all the
" punctuation in the number row (non-shifted) to send numbers in normal mode
" since they're used so often, but in insert mode they will
" be the punctuation. note that I use a slightly modified layout, so if
" you c/p this it will not work the same with normal programmer dvorak.
